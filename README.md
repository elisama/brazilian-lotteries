## About the project

To analyze the two lottery problems and then publish an article in a scientific journal.

**Problem 1:** Is it possible to have a minimum number of bets (betting pool) that ensures the bettor receives at least one of the secondary prizes?

**Problem 2:** Is it possible to identify any bias in the lottery? If so, is it possible to generate a strategy that significantly increases the bettor's outcome?
